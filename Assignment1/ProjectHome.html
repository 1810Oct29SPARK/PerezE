                <strong><p>What is computer vision?</p></strong>
                <p>
                    Computer vision is when a computer is able to see the world with a camera. This includes your laptop, smartphone,
                    and various other things. Want to find out more? Click <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision"target="_blank">

                <p>
                    My project involved using computer vision and using the information to move a arm around and pick up
                    a screw and place it in a container. It had to know how and where to move based on the position of
                    the arm and where the screw was placed. I was able to complete this project within a month and 
                    managed to complete the tast perfectly.

                <strong><p>What is it used for?</p></strong>
                <p>
                    Computer vision is used in many various technologies, just like your smartphone. Modern smartphones can recognize
                    when there is a face in the picture and creates a box around it or can even change how you look. For example,
                    a phone company named Honor is making a smartphone with a built in AI that can tell what it is that you are 
                    trying to take a picture of. The AI in the phone is using computer vision to tell what it is that it is looking 
                    at and with that information it guesses what the object is.
