                and I had the money to check this place out. I am glad I did because I loved my time here, so much in fact that I actually ended
                up taking an extra week just staying here in the hotel and doing all of the various activities that they offer. Not to mention
                the food, which was AMAZING! I would totaly recommend comming here to anyone who has the money to come here because I really 
                didn't want to leave.</h4>

                complaint is that they didn't have my prefered red wine. Their selection was great 
                and found other very good wines but not my go-to.</h4>

                <h4><img src="Five.png" alt="5star" width="100vw">Excellent Hotel! Myself and 2 friends decided to stay at the EP Hotel for our visit to Italy and study of the history, 
                and we were very impressed! The hotel is beautiful, the service was great, the complimentary reception with free drinks and snacks was great, and the complimentary 
                breakfast was very good. I am not a EP Honors member, and from now on I will always book EP Hotel when I travel to Italy. I highly recommend this location to 
                anyone looking for a great stay!</h4>
